### checkerboard observation positions for capturing calibration images
# List of robot configurations (arm and camera angles in [rad]) for observing the checkerboard attached to robot's end effector
# Includes <arm_dof>,<camera_dof> parameters per entry. One entry is defined by one line.
# Each entry consists of the arm angles first and then the camera angles in the end.
