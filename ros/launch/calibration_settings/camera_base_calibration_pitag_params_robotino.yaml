### Robot link and topic names
# the robot base frame [the transformation between laser scanner and base should be accomplished before]
base_frame: "base_linkz"

# this is the camera coordinate system which refers to the color image sensor [the transformations between camera_frame and camera_optical_frame should be available from tf]
camera_optical_frame: "kinect_rgb_optical_frame"

# the transformations between base_frame and the first entry of the uncertainties list and the last entry and camera_optical_frame has to be be available from TF
# the list contains couples from parent to child. Each couple defines an uncertainty in the kinematic chain which will be calibrated by the program
# the list must be in order, i.e. uncertainties earlier in the list must also be earlier in the kinematic chain
# take into account that the transformations between the uncertainties have to be available from TF as well

# defines the order in which the uncertainties will be calibrated
# each couple or uncertainty in the uncertainties_list increases the calibration_order list
# the value represents the index of an uncertainty in the uncertainties_list and the position of the index in the calibration_order list defines the actual order
# i.e. the first element in the calibration_order will be calibrated first, then comes the second element and so on...
# the more uncertain a transform is the earlier should its index be placed in the calibration_order list. So, the most uncertain transform should be the first element.
calibration_order: [1,2]

# base name of all frames generated by cob_fiducials, each Pi tag number will be attached to this string.
