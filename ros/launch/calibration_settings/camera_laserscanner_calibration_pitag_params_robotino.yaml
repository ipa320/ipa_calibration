### Robot link and topic names
# the robot base frame, needed for security measure (it's the reference frame to check the child_frame against before moving the robot)
base_frame: "base_linkz"

# The name of the reference frame. Has to match the entry found in the relative_localization yaml files.
# string
reference_frame: "/landmark_reference_nav"

# this is the camera coordinate system which refers to the color image sensor [the transformations between camera_frame and camera_optical_frame should be available from tf]
#camera_optical_frame: "kinect_depth_optical_frame"

# the transformations between base_frame and the first entry of the uncertainties list and the last entry and camera_optical_frame has to be be available from TF
# the list contains couples from parent to child. Each couple defines an uncertainty in the kinematic chain which will be calibrated by the program
# the list must be in order, i.e. uncertainties earlier in the list must also be earlier in the kinematic chain
# take into account that the transformations between the uncertainties have to be available from TF as well

# [parent frame, child frame, last parent-branch frame, last child-branch frame, parent marker, child marker]
