### checkerboard observation positions for capturing calibration images
# List of robot configurations (arm and camera angles in [rad]) for observing the checkerboard attached to robot's end effector
# Includes <arm_dof>,<camera_dof> parameters per entry. One entry is defined by one line.
# Each entry consists of the arm angles first and then the camera angles in the end.
robot_configurations: []

# the transformations between base_frame and the first entry of the uncertainties list and the last entry and camera_optical_frame has to be be available from TF
# the list contains couples from parent to child. Each couple defines an uncertainty in the kinematic chain which will be calibrated by the program
# the list must be in order, i.e. uncertainties earlier in the list must also be earlier in the kinematic chain
# take into account that the transformations between the uncertainties have to be available from TF as well
uncertainties_list: ["base_linkz","arm_base_link"]

# defines the order in which the uncertainties will be calibrated
# each couple or uncertainty in the uncertainties_list increases the calibration_order list
# the value represents the index of an uncertainty in the uncertainties_list and the position of the index in the calibration_order list defines the actual order
# i.e. the first element in the calibration_order will be calibrated first, then comes the second element and so on...
# the more uncertain a transform is the earlier should its index be placed in the calibration_order list
# so the index of the most uncertain transform should be the first element here
calibration_order: [1]
